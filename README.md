# Transformer_Time_Series

This is an official implementation of Modelling Long- and Short-term Multi-dimensional Patterns in Predictive Maintenance with Accumulative Attention

The proposed TCNASA model integrates the temporal convolution network (TCN) and accumulative self-attention layer (ASA).

The dilated-causal convolution-based TCN is shown in dilated_causal_convolution_layer.py and the ASA module is shown in accumulative_attention_layer.py

A demo synthetic dataset as constructed in dataset.py

Please run the accumulative_attention_layer.ipynb in jupyter
